# Simple Space Invaders Style Browser Game (Proof of Concept)

## Overview

Develop a simple, browser-based game inspired by the classic **Space Invaders** using the **Phaser** game framework. This proof of concept (PoC) will focus on core gameplay mechanics while being designed with modularity in mind. The architecture must allow for easy addition of features like weapons, various enemies, power-ups, and levels in future iterations. The game will be designed for desktop browsers only, with a fixed-size canvas and no responsive design.

## Objectives

- **Create a basic playable version** of Space Invaders using Phaser.
- **Implement a modular code structure** to facilitate future enhancements.
- **Ensure cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on desktop.
- **Provide comprehensive documentation** for future development.

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Player

- **Control**: A spaceship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen.
- **Movement**: Left and right movement within screen bounds.
- **Shooting**: Fires projectiles vertically upwards to destroy enemies.

### 2. Enemies

- **Formation**: A grid of enemies that move collectively.
- **Movement**:
  - Horizontal movement across the screen.
  - Moves down one level upon reaching screen edge.
- **Behavior**: Optionally, enemies speed up as their numbers decrease.

### 3. Projectiles

- **Player Projectiles**: Fired upwards to hit enemies.
- **Enemy Projectiles** (optional for PoC): Fired downwards to hit the player.

### 4. Collision Detection

- **Player Projectiles vs. Enemies**: Destroy enemy upon hit.
- **Enemy Projectiles vs. Player**: Reduce player's lives upon hit.
- **Enemies vs. Player**: Game over if enemies reach the player's level.

### 5. Game States

- **Start Screen**: Displays game title and 'Start Game' button.
- **Gameplay**: Main game loop.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays 'Game Over' or 'Victory' message with an option to restart.

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Technologies

- **Framework**: Phaser 3.
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Markup**: HTML5.
- **Styling**: CSS3.
- **Rendering**: Handled by Phaser's rendering engine.

### 2. Game Configuration

- **Fixed Canvas Size**: Set to a fixed width and height (e.g., 800x600 pixels).
- **Desktop Only**: No responsive design; the game is intended for desktop browsers.
- **No Mobile Support**: Touch controls and mobile optimizations are not required.

### 3. Code Structure

- **Modularity**:
  - Utilize Phaser's scene management to organize code.
  - Separate concerns (e.g., game logic, rendering, input handling).
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Classes for `Player`, `Enemy`, `Projectile`, `GameScene`, `StartScene`, `GameOverScene`.
- **Game Loop**:
  - Use Phaser's built-in game loop for updating game state and rendering.

### 4. Assets

- **Graphics**:
  - Use simple shapes or placeholder sprites provided by Phaser.
  - Placeholder images can be replaced later with custom graphics.
- **Sounds** (optional for PoC):
  - Basic sound effects for shooting and explosions.
- **Asset Management**:
  - Organize assets in dedicated folders (`/assets/images`, `/assets/sounds`).

### 5. Controls

- **Keyboard**:
  - **Left Arrow / 'A'**: Move left.
  - **Right Arrow / 'D'**: Move right.
  - **Spacebar**: Fire projectile.

### 6. User Interface

- **Lives Remaining**: Displays player's remaining lives.
- **Score Display** (optional for PoC): Shows the player's score.

## Modularity for Future Extensions

### 1. Scene Management

- **Phaser Scenes**:
  - **StartScene**: Main menu and game initialization.
  - **GameScene**: Core gameplay mechanics.
  - **GameOverScene**: Displays results and options to restart.

### 2. Entity System

- **Base Class `Entity`**:
  - Common properties: sprite, position, velocity.
  - Common methods: `update()`, `destroy()`.
- **Derived Classes**:
  - `Player`, `Enemy`, `Projectile`.
- **Extension Points**:
  - Easily add new entity types like `PowerUp`, `BossEnemy`.

### 3. Event System

- Use Phaser's event emitter for handling game events.
  - **Events**: Collision events, score updates, game state changes.

### 4. Configuration

- **Settings Object**:
  - Use a JavaScript object for game settings (e.g., speeds, spawn rates).
- **Dynamic Loading**:
  - Load configurations at game start for easy adjustments.

### 5. Asset Management

- Leverage Phaser's asset loading system.
  - **Preloading**: Load all assets in the `PreloadScene` before the game starts.

## Development Milestones

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Player Implementation**

- **Task 1**: Set up the Phaser project with a fixed canvas size (e.g., 800x600 pixels).
- **Task 2**: Create `StartScene` with a 'Start Game' button.
- **Task 3**: Implement the `Player` class with movement and shooting in `GameScene`.

### **Phase 2: Enemy Implementation**

- **Task 4**: Implement the `Enemy` class and generate an enemy formation.
- **Task 5**: Program enemy movement patterns in `GameScene`.
- **Task 6**: Display enemies on the screen.

### **Phase 3: Projectile and Collision**

- **Task 7**: Implement the `Projectile` class for player projectiles.
- **Task 8**: Handle firing mechanics and projectile movement.
- **Task 9**: Implement collision detection between projectiles and enemies.

### **Phase 4: Game States and Logic**

- **Task 10**: Implement `GameOverScene` to display game over and victory messages.
- **Task 11**: Add win/loss condition logic in `GameScene`.
- **Task 12**: Add basic UI elements (lives remaining, optional score display).

### **Phase 5: Modularity and Refactoring**

- **Task 13**: Refactor codebase for enhanced modularity and readability.
- **Task 14**: Document code and create guidelines for future extensions.
- **Task 15**: Optimize performance and fix any bugs.
