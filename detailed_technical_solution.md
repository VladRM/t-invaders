# Detailed Technical Solution

## Project Overview
The project is a Phaser-based space shooter game that uses a modular design to organize game logic, asset management, collisions, and UI functionality. The code base is divided into several modules, each responsible for distinct aspects of the game such as player control, enemy behavior, collision handling, and scene management.

## Key Components

### 1. Game State Management
- **GameState Singleton:**  
  Implemented in `gameState.js`, this singleton holds global game variables such as score, high score, current level, lives, and win/lose state. The `reset()` method ensures that the game state is correctly re-initialized at the start of a new game.
- **SceneManager Singleton:**  
  Found in `sceneManager.js`, this singleton deals with scene transitions and centralizes logic for moving between menu screens and game levels. The design choice of using a singleton here simplifies scene management and avoids multiple instances that might lead to inconsistent transitions.

### 2. Modular Scenes and Background Management
- **BaseLevelScene:**  
  This abstract scene, defined in `baseLevelScene.js`, encapsulates common functionalities such as background scrolling, explosion animations, collision detection, and player updates. This approach minimizes code duplication and allows different levels (e.g., Level1 and Level2) to extend common behavior.
- **Scene-Specific Refactoring:**  
  The levels (`level_1.js` and `level_2.js`) utilize shared logic from BaseLevelScene and further customize enemy formations, firing patterns, and game objectives. The background is managed via dedicated helpers in `background.js`, which creates and updates tiled background images for a seamless scrolling effect.

### 3. Collision and Overlap Handling
- **Centralized Collision Management:**  
  Instead of using Phaser’s default collision detection in isolation, the game implements a custom collision management approach. Centralized collision callbacks are used to handle player projectiles versus enemy collisions and enemy projectiles versus the player. This approach was chosen to handle transparency issues in sprites and to allow more precise control over collision responses.
- **Configuration Driven Approach:**  
  Collision radii and geometry are managed through constants stored in `config.js`. This decision not only makes magic numbers explicit but also facilitates easy adjustments and consistency across the code base.

### 4. Explosion and Animation Handling
- **Centralized Explosion Logic:**  
  The `explosion.js` module provides a uniform mechanism for creating and cleaning up explosion animations across the game. This module standardizes how explosions are invoked, ensuring consistent visual feedback throughout the game.

### 5. Weapons and Projectile Management
- **Player and Enemy Weapons:**  
  The `weapons.js` file handles the creation and firing of projectiles. It utilizes object pooling to manage projectile reuse, which is critical for performance enhancements in high-action scenes.
- **Auto-Firing for Enemies:**  
  Enemy weapons are designed to auto-fire using their own timer logic. This logic is encapsulated within the Weapon class and is triggered through an initial delayed call, providing variability in enemy firing without cluttering enemy behavior logic.

### 6. Player and Enemy Modules
- **Player Module:**  
  The player is defined in `player.js` where it integrates movement, shooting, and life management. The collision boundaries for the player are set according to constants defined in the configuration.
- **Enemy Module:**  
  The `enemies.js` file contains both individual enemy behavior and the logic for organising enemies into groups. The EnemyGroup class handles the collective movement and firing patterns of enemy rows, while the Enemy class manages individual enemy's state, weapon firing, and explosion effects when destroyed.
- **Death and Damage Handling:**  
  Upon collision, enemies or the player are immediately disabled (their sprites are made inactive and their physics bodies turned off) to prevent repeated collision handling. This cautious approach ensures that rapid consecutive collisions do not cause multiple processing events.

## Rationale Behind Technical Decisions

- **Explicit Collision Management:**  
  The choice to centralize collision logic via manual checks instead of relying solely on Phaser’s built-in functions was driven by the need for precise control over what happens upon collision (such as explosion effects and projectile recycling). This approach mitigates issues with sprite transparency and overlapping actors.
  
- **Modularization for Duplication Reduction:**  
  Breaking out common functionalities (like background handling and explosions) into separate modules improves code reuse and simplifies the maintenance of core game functionalities.
  
- **Singletons for Global State:**  
  The use of singletons for game state and scene management ensures that there is a single source of truth throughout the game’s lifecycle, reducing the risk of state inconsistencies.
  
- **Projectile Pooling:**  
  Implementing object pooling for projectiles in weapons helps to reduce performance overhead from frequent object creation and destruction, a common bottleneck in fast-paced games.

## Future Development Considerations
- **Enhanced Collision Systems:**  
  As the game scales, consider leveraging Phaser’s physics engine with custom collision callbacks in order to further optimize collision detection performance.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:**  
  An event-driven approach could decouple game state updates and scene transitions even further, making the addition of new levels or mechanics easier.
- **Improved Config Management:**  
  As more constants and settings are likely to be added, moving configuration into a more dynamic system (like a JSON file loaded at runtime) may increase flexibility.
- **Refinement of Enemy Behaviors:**  
  Future iterations might include more complex enemy AI and firing patterns, potentially through scripting or a behavior tree pattern.
